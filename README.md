# House Price Prediction

## Project Overview
Surprise Housing, a US-based housing company, is expanding into the Australian market. The company specializes in purchasing houses below market value and selling them for a profit. This project involves building a regression model using regularization techniques to predict the value of prospective properties in Australia, aiding the company in investment decisions.

## Dataset Description
The dataset comprises various attributes of houses sold in Australia. It includes details like location, size, price, and other relevant features. The data definition is provided in an accompanying text file.

## Analysis Approach
- **Objective**: Identify significant variables affecting house prices and optimize lambda values for ridge and lasso regression.
- **Methodology**: Regularized regression models (Ridge and Lasso) are utilized to predict house prices and interpret the influence of different variables.
- **Tools Used**: Python libraries (specific versions to be listed), Jupyter Notebooks.

## Findings
1. **Key Variables**: Identified the most significant predictors of house prices.
2. **Model Performance**: Evaluated the accuracy of the regression models in price prediction.
3. **Optimal Lambda**: Determined the best lambda values for both ridge and lasso regression.

## Setup and Running the Code
Instructions on setting up the environment and running the code are provided in a separate file.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, Numpy (specific versions)
- Scikit-learn (specific version)
- Jupyter Notebook
